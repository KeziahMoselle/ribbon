# Bookmarks tracking

This is an application which aim to help you complete reading your bookmarks and get rid of them (once and for all !)

This will be done by collecting your bookmarks via OAuth

Supported services :
- Reddit (Saved)
- Twitter (Bookmark)
- Youtube (Watch later)

After that you will be able to configure notifications

Then the app will start sending you notifications to remind you that you have bookmarks to read.

It will also need to update it's data, so periodically it will re-fetch data from every connected services
